# 🧠 BITS DevHub – Team Space

Welcome to the team space of **BITS DevHub**, the official GitHub-based student tech community at  
**BABA Institute of Technology and Sciences (A), Visakhapatnam**.

## 🌱 Current Status
This team is in its early growth phase.  
Right now, it’s a one-person mission — building, organizing, and preparing everything from scratch.

Once GitHub officially recognizes our chapter, we’ll open up core roles for passionate students from:
- CSE
- AIML
- Cyber Security
- and other tech branches

## 🎯 Vision
To form a creative, collaborative team that:
- Runs workshops and hackathons
- Creates open source learning projects
- Spreads GitHub culture across the campus

## 🙋‍♂️ Interested in Joining?
We’ll begin onboarding once our GitHub Campus Expert proposal is approved.  
Stay tuned on GitHub and Instagram (coming soon)!
